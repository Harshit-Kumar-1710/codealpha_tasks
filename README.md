# Basic-Network-Sniffer
Project 1

I have created a Basic Network Sniffer Project using the Python Programming Language. This Project captures all the Packets around the Network Traffic and analyzes them .We can also Analyze the Packets based on the Various Protocol Types.


# A Network Intrusion Detection System
Project 2

I have created a Basic Network Intrusion Detection System through Python which has the same functionalities as of Basic Network Sniffer but in addition to it can detect the Suspicious Packets in the Network Traffic based on the Various Protocols.I have imported various Libraries such as scapy,time for timeout ,ctypes for administrator privileges and also installed Npcap to scan at the Level 2 Layer.
